Project Jupyter’s tools are available for installation via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), the leading repository of software created for the Python programming language.

This page uses instructions with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [the recommended installation tool for Python](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/#installation-tool-recommendations).
